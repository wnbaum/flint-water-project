Le Ch\xe2telier\u2019s Principle dictates that in an equilibrium system - such as the lead (II) carbonate - the products and reactants will try to maintain a constant ratio. If one of the products is in less concentration, then more will be made. The lead (II) carbonate system looks like PbCO3 (s) \u21cc Pb2+ (aq) + CO32\u2013 (aq) in chemistry terms. This by itself is unaffected by pH, but one of the products, CO32-, can react with the hydrogen ions found in water (see the above section).
