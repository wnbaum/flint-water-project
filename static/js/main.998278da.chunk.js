Le Ch\xe2telier\u2019s Principle dictates that in an equilibrium system - such as the lead (II) carbonate - the products and reactants will try to maintain a constant ratio. If one of the products is in less concentration, then more will be made. The lead (II) carbonate system looks like PbCO3 (s) \u21cc Pb2+ (aq) + CO32\u2013 (aq) in chemistry terms. This by itself is unaffected by pH, but one of the products, CO32-, can react with the hydrogen ions found in water (see the above section). When pH is lower, there are more hydrogen ions, which increases the rate of this exchange, removing more and more CO32-  from the system."),r.a.createElement("h1",{style:{fontWeight:"normal"}},"This means that as the pH is lowered, the  lead (II) carbonate system wants to create more Pb2+ ions, leaving less PbCO3.
